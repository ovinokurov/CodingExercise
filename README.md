Given a two dimensional array of letters, write a method that finds whether a given word exists in the array. The word is composed of letters in adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically neighboring only) where the same cell may not be used more than once.

Letters = [

['A','B','C','E'],

['S','F','C','S'],

['A','D','E','E']

]

Given word = "ABCCED", return true.

Given word = "SEE", return true.
